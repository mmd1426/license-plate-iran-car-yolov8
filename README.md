# License Plate Iran Car Yolov8

## Introduction
This project is designed for the detection and recognition of Iranian car license plates using deep learning techniques and the YOLOv8 model. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of detecting car license plates for various applications, such as traffic monitoring and smart parking systems.

## Features
- **YOLOv8 for License Plate Detection**: Detect and recognize Iranian car license plates in images.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Includes steps like resizing and enhancing image quality to optimize model performance.
- **High Accuracy**: The model is trained to accurately detect license plates from various cars.

## Model
- The **YOLOv8** model is used for car license plate detection.
- The model has been trained and fine-tuned on images of Iranian car license plates.

## Contribution
Your contributions are welcome! Feel free to report issues or submit pull requests to improve the project.
